            <description>Returns a collection of the most recent Tweets posted by
                the user indicated by the screen_name or user_id parameters. User
                timelines belonging to protected users may only be requested when
                the authenticated user either "owns" the timeline or is an approved
                follower of the owner

        <component name="getMentionsTimeline">
            <file>get_mentions_timeline.xml</file>
            <description>Returns the 20 most recent mentions (tweets containing a
                users's @screen_name) for the authenticating user. The timeline
                returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view your
                mentions on twitter.com. This method can only return up to 800
                tweets

            <description>Returns the most recent tweets authored by the
                authenticating user that have been retweeted by others. This
                timeline is a subset of the user's GET statuses/user_timeline. See
                Working with Timelines for instructions on traversing timelines.
